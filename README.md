### Convolutional Neural Networks

This repo contains two notebooks tutorials used to present a introductory workshop about neural networks and convolutional neural networks.

In this notebooks you will find several examples on how to implement neural networks and ConvNets with tensorflow:

Before start the notebooks please make sure you are using python 3.5 or greater version
Then run this command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies
Uncompress the file data.zip
Finally run `jupyter notebook`
